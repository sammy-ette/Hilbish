Unfortunately I missed the official date, but I will still make a more
focused post on the date (19st).</p><p>I decided to fix up this website and Hilbish&#39;s logo, so that can
be thought of as something for the 2 years milestone?</p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Logo-Hilbish&#39;s-old-logo-was..-not-that-good.-It-definitely-functioned-as-a-logo-but-the-yellow-part-of-it-looked-ugly-(sorry-old-logo).">Logo
Hilbish&#39;s old logo was.. not that good. It definitely functioned
as a logo, but the yellow part of it looked ugly (sorry old logo).</h1><p>&lt;img src=&quot;https://safe.kashima.moe/4c6e9q484pcy.png&quot; width=256&gt;
&lt;br&gt;</p><p>You would have definitely seen the new logo, since it is currently
in use on the navigation bar and footer. Here it is in a bigger view:

# Website
Ever since this website was first made, from the release of v2.0, it has
been doing it&#39;s job of being a website good enough, but there were a few issues.</p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Padding-Padding-is-very-important-The-edges-of-your-screen-need-space-to-do-nothing-after-all.-On-mobile-or-screens-small-enough-there-would-not-be-enough-space-for-the-auto-margin-to-fill-and-since-there-was-no-padding-besides-that-it-means-things-would-look-a-bit-cramped.-This-was-simple-to-fix.">Padding
Padding is very important! The edges of your screen need space to do nothing,
after all. On mobile or screens small enough, there would not be enough space
for the auto margin to fill, and since there was no padding besides that,
it means things would look a bit cramped. This was simple to fix.</h1><p>Here it is before:

<img alt="After" src="https://safe.kashima.moe/r0ox4nazfi0q.png"></p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Docs-Navigation-On-the-docs-page-the-pages-are-on-the-left-on-desktop.-Since-phones-are-too-small-to-have-this-content-on-the-side-it-stays-at-the-top.-This-is-a-bit-counter-intuitive-since-it-brings-in-extra-scrolling-when-navigating-to-every-page-for-docs-and-just-doesn&#39;t-look-that-good.">Docs Navigation
On the docs page, the pages are on the left on desktop. Since
phones are too small to have this content on the side, it stays at the top.
This is a bit counter intuitive since it brings in extra scrolling
when navigating to every page for docs and just doesn&#39;t look that good.</h1><p>A few months ago I made it collapse with the site wide navigation, but it
was not hidden by default. So a few improvements were made:
- Make the doc navigation hidden by default on mobile, just like site wide navigation
- Make doc navigation have the same look as site wide navigation</p><p>Here&#39;s a before:  
<img alt src="https://safe.kashima.moe/krn0a6qwegdj.png"></p><p>and after:  
<img alt src="https://safe.kashima.moe/sk11ighz47yb.png"></p><p>Looks a lot better now.</p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Other-Changes-If-you-haven&#39;t-noticed-I-have-made-other-changes-to-the-website.-This-includes:---Borders-Something-this-simple-makes-the-website-look-a-lot-better-especially-on-mobile.---More-padding-and-margin-everywhere.-Home-doc-pages-blog-post-listing.">Other Changes
If you haven&#39;t noticed, I have made other changes to the website.
This includes:
- Borders! Something this simple makes the website look a lot better, especially on mobile.
- More padding and margin everywhere. Home, doc pages, blog post listing.</h1></div></body></html>

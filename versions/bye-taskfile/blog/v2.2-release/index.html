seen at the <a href="https://github.com/sammy-ette/Hilbish/releases/tag/v2.2.0">v2.2.0</a>
tag.</p><p>Welcome to a very long awaited release of Hilbish, and on Christmas. Just think
of it as a long preparing, late Christmas gift. :)
This release does not contain a whole lot of changes, but it is a new
release with enhancements and bug fixes!</p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Documentation-As-is-a-trend-the-documentation-has-been-improved-by-ONE-HUNDRED-TIMES.-Okay-not-quite-but-they&#39;ve-definitely-been-given-an-uplift.-Everything-has-been-rewritten-new-documentation-has-been-added-to-both-the-website-and-the-local-docs-accessible-with-the-doc-command.-Both-the-website-and-local-docs-are-now-in-sync-with-each-other.">Documentation
As is a trend, the documentation has been improved by ONE HUNDRED TIMES.
Okay, not quite, but they&#39;ve definitely been given an uplift.
Everything has been rewritten, new documentation has been added to both
the website and the local docs accessible with the <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">doc</code> command.
Both the website and local docs are now in sync with each other.</h1><p>This means that the <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">doc</code> command has also been improved to consolidate
the documentation changes. It looks a lot better, has pagination, etc!</p><p>Speaking of pagination...
# Features
## Greenhouse
The first new added feature is the Greenhouse pager! It is a library and
command accessible via <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">greenhouse</code>. It will have better integration with
Hilbish things, like notifications and can be used as a base for displaying
multi-line text output instead of paging to less. The usage of Greenhouse is
more efficient and better in Hibish!</p><h2 class="my-2 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-3xl" id="Notifications-Wait...-notifications-Yes-All-new-in-the-2.2-release-is-a-generic-notification-interface-for-things-in-Hilbish-to-alert-the-user-of-things-going-on.-Stuff-like-background-jobs-finishing-simple-alarms-actual-messages-whatever-you-like.">Notifications
Wait... notifications? Yes! All new in the 2.2 release is a generic notification
interface for things in Hilbish to alert the user of things going on. Stuff like
background jobs finishing, simple alarms, <strong>actual messages</strong>, whatever you like.</h2><h2 class="my-2 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-3xl" id="Fuzzy-Searching-Users-can-now-use-fuzzy-search-for-command-history-and-completion-search.-Enable-it-with-hilbish.opts.fuzzy-=-true">Fuzzy Searching
Users can now use fuzzy search for command history and completion search.
Enable it with <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">hilbish.opts.fuzzy = true</code>!</h2><h3 class="my-1 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-2xl" id="Smaller-Enhancements-Did-you-know-of-the-cdr-command-I-personally-don&#39;t-use-it-but-I&#39;ve-made-it-look-slightly-better-for-ease-of-use.-That-simple-change-is-adding-the-indexes-next-to-the-directory-so-you&#39;ll-know-to-type-cdr-2.">Smaller Enhancements
Did you know of the <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">cdr</code> command? I personally don&#39;t use it, but I&#39;ve made
it look slightly better for ease of use. That simple change is adding the indexes
next to the directory so you&#39;ll know to type <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">cdr 2</code>.</h3><p>Users can now add aliases with numbered substitutions. In shell script,
some people have to make functions for certain things that are actually
just aliases. A simple example: <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">nix run nixpkgs#package</code> cannot be aliased
because if it was aliased to something like <code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">run</code> normally there would be a space after.</p><p>Simple fix:
<code class="text-violet-600 dark:text-violet-400">lua
hilbish.alias(&#39;run&#39;, &#39;nix run nixpkgs#%1&#39;)
</code></p><p>Rejoice!</p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Bug-Fixes-There-are-a-small-amount-of-bug-fixes-but-they&#39;re-still-fixes">Bug Fixes
There are a small amount of bug fixes but they&#39;re still fixes!</h1><p>In some cases Hilbish will panic if:
- Alias resolution results in something empty
- A user does not return a table in a runner functions
These are both fixed.</p><p>An infinite loop has been patched out if someone navigates without
having any prior history. Imagine pressing the up key on a fresh Hilbish
install and you shell no longer working... that&#39;s gone now.</p><p>Something else that&#39;s gone... is still Windows support, but I added a fix
which will make file completion work now. Job management commands work as
well now too due to an oversight when changing up the job functions.</p><h1 class="my-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-300 font-bold text-4xl" id="Towards-v2.3-For-the-next-release-I&#39;m-hoping-that-it-won&#39;t-take-as-long-to-deliver-on-what-is-realistically-a-small-amount-of-changes.-So-v2.3-will-be-coming-in-a-short-time-with-some-good-changes-promise-See-you-in-the-next-blog-post.">Towards v2.3
For the next release, I&#39;m hoping that it won&#39;t take as long to deliver on
what is realistically a small amount of changes. So v2.3 will be coming
in a short time with some good changes, promise! See you in the
next blog post.</h1></div></body></html>
